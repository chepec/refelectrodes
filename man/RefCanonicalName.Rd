\description{
Given a reference electrode label, this function returns its canonical name
(as defined by this package).
This function tries to match against as many variations as possible for each
reference electrode.
The entire point of this function is to decrease the mental load on the user
by not requiring them to remember a particular label or name for each reference
electrode, instead almost any sufficiently distinct label or string will still
be correctly identified.
